# Code Changes

Non-test code changes are now permitted for:
- Bug fixes with corresponding test coverage
- Refactoring with existing test coverage
- Removal of deprecated features (QuietHours, CalendarEditor)

For new features or significant changes, add tests first.

Previously the name of this rule was 

dont change any non test code without getting confirmation first

and its body:

dont change any non test code without getting confirmation first. this is a very old application I'm working on making a thorough test suite for before making any changes. 

now the test suite is a lot more robust we've relaxed the rule a bit but still be cognizant of it


# Work to make tests as faithful to the real code as possible

its ok to mock out core android apis that the instrumentation testsuite doesn't work well with i.e. making push notifications but try to use the real original code for anything that exists in this codebase


# Don't try to boil the ocean. Dont try to make big sweeping changes when more focused ones will do

Always think of the minimum viable solution to a problem or change to make. make sure that works and then build on top of it. break things down into small testable pieces first. That said NO CHEATING! I.e. don't comment out or skip a test to solve a problem unless its just a temporary bandaid while working on something more important.

# keep all code implementations as consise as possible.

Everything it needs nothing it doesn't. Every new line of code is one that potentially doesn't work 😄


# Please check the documentation if you are implementing something potentially complex or nonstandard.

often there are things we've learned already i.e. 

docs/dev_completed/constructor-mocking-android.md

documents how through a lot work an reserch we learned 

mockKStatic, mockConstructor and anyConstructed ALMOST ALWAYS FAIL. And aren't worth trying anymore where there are better alternatives.

also 

docs/calendar_monitoring.md

goes into DEEP detail about how calendar monitoring works in the app
