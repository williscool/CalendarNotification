can you write script inspired by bundle android that usese these 2 commands 

to clean logs for me to share with you

1. chop off all lines before the line with eventsv9 or before the first CalMonitorSvcTest log
get rid of the time stamp and other cruft before the line status 
cut any exceptions to the status line plus 10 or until the first CalMonitorSvcTest line in the stacktrace

can use our copy to and from code a quck node script for this so I dont have to do it manually all the time
