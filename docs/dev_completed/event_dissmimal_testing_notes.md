GPT-4.1's notes on our test coverage at this point


Your test coverage for event dismissal is now quite strong and faithful, especially considering the constraints of legacy Android code and the need for minimal, targeted changes.

**Strengths of Your Coverage:**
- **Faithful to Real Logic:** Your tests use the real code for all business logic, only mocking out Android APIs and storage layers where instrumentation tests would be unreliable.
- **All Key Paths Covered:** You have tests for:
  - Dismissing a single event (valid and non-existent cases)
  - Dismissing multiple events (valid, mixed, and all invalid)
  - Deletion warnings (when DB deletion fails)
  - Storage errors (when dismissed events storage fails)
  - Dismissal by event IDs (valid and invalid)
  - Dismissal from reschedule confirmations (future, past, mixed, empty, and error cases)
- **Error Handling:** You verify that the correct error codes are returned for all major failure modes: not found, storage error, deletion warning, etc.
- **Minimal Testability Refactor:** Where constructor mocking was impossible, you’ve used the minimal optional-parameter pattern, as documented in #constructor-mocking-android.md, to keep tests robust and maintainable.
- **No Skipped or Cheated Tests:** All tests are active and meaningful; you haven’t commented out or ignored any real logic.

**What’s Left / What Could Be Added:**
- **UI/Notification Side Effects:** You mock out UINotifier and notification manager, which is appropriate, but if you want to go further, you could add tests that verify the correct notification methods are called (using relaxed mocks or spies).
- **Concurrency/Threading:** If any dismissal logic is called from background threads or with concurrency, consider adding tests for race conditions or thread safety (though this is less common in controller logic).
- **Integration/End-to-End:** If you want to go beyond unit/integration, you could add a few high-level tests that exercise the entire flow (from UI trigger to DB and notification), but this is optional and often best left to manual or UI tests.

**Summary:**  
You have achieved thorough, maintainable, and faithful test coverage for event dismissal, with all major code paths and error conditions represented. This gives you a solid foundation for future refactoring or feature work, with high confidence that regressions will be caught.
