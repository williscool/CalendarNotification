This app replaces default calendar event notifications with an enhanced version that provides snooze functionality and notification persistence. It's designed to be transparent in its operation - calendar notifications behave as expected, with direct clicks opening event details in your default calendar application. The enhanced functionality is provided through additional actions in the notifications.

When snoozing events, you can snooze them a desired amount of time or quickly reschedule them with just one click. All your notification states persist through device reboots, ensuring you never miss an important event.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This project is a maintained fork of the original [Calendar Notifications](https://github.com/quarck/CalendarNotification) app. When the original was archived in 2020, we took on the responsibility of maintaining and enhancing it to ensure continued compatibility with modern Android versions while adding new features like cloud data backup.
